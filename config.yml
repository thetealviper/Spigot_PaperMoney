Enable_Money_Splitting: true
#Set this to true to allow players to turn larger bills into smaller bills
#THIS IS LITERALLY A PAPER DUPE. WARNING. THIS, BY DEFINITION, IS A PAPER DUPE.
#Enable this with care and don't say I didn't warn you.
#As added precaution, players also need the permission for splitting found
#    in the permission section below.

Min_Amount: 1
#This is used so players can't make paper money worth $0 and duplicate paper.

Maximum_Decimal_Places: 2
#This is to how many places past the decimal point currency can go
# $19.999 for example would be 3. Most real life currency doesn't go this far.
# $19.99 would be 2. This is where most real life currency goes.
# $19.9 would be 1. This is shorter than real life currency
# $1 would be 0. This limits money to whole numbers.
